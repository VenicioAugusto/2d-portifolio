## ðŸ’» About the project

For this project, I chose a 2D Sidescroller type of gameplay.

I created a Character Controller script from scratch, the character can move sideways, jump, run, crouch and move while crouching.

I created a Combat script, which allows the player to engage enemies in two different ways, melee combat and ranged combat, both are editable to adjust the damage of each weapon.

I also created a Movement script for the enemies as well as a simple AI that makes the enemies increase their speed when they see the player.

To finish the project I added a health system for both player and enemies, this contemplates the in-Unity editable script as well as a HUD, for enemies I also added critical damage when they take damage from behind.
